				<h1>Distributed Systems:</h1>
					<p>Dstributed systems add another level of complexity. You have to decide how
to deal with an external dependency failing. If your system is very distributed,
this may be a common occurrence. Make sure your logging policy takes this
into account.
In general, the best indication that everything is all right is that the messages
at a lower priority are ticking along happily. I want about one INFO-level log
message for every significant application event.
A cluttered log is an indication that the system will be hard to control once it
reaches production. If you donâ€™t expect anything to show up in the error log, it
will be much easier to know what to do when something does show up.</p>
